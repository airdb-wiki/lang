达里奥：我在书里写了几百个原则，但我最重要的工作和生活原则主要是这5个
It&amp;rsquo;s that I&amp;rsquo;m in in a transition in my life from the second phase of my life to the thrid phase of my life.
What I mean by that is that I believe that life happens in three phases.

In the second phase of your life you&amp;rsquo;re working.</description></item></channel></rss>
