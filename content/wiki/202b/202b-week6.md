Very polite: 		Would you mind waiting a moment?
Informal:		Can you…?
More direct:		Would you…?
Even more direct:	Will you…? → This is almost like an order



### B Type:  Permission

The best all-purpose polite phrase is: Could I…?

Could I step out of the room for a moment?

More polite/formal:	  May   I ask you a question?
Informal:		Can I borrow this?



### C Type: Ability

The best modal to use is can.
			We can deliver within three working days.

We use   could   for the past and some conditionals.
I   could   swim when I was 5 years old.
I would if I  cloud   . → This doesn’t have past meaning

Use (be) + able to for the present perfect tense or when you have a second modal.
			We have been able to source the materials.
We may be able to help you.
We will be able to do it.

One-time events:	I was able to / I managed to
e.g. He could was able to pass that difficult exam. (ability in a specific past event)
       He was able to/could run fast when he wanted to. (general ability in the past)




### D Type: Possibility

We usually use may, could or   might  .
			The goods may be in already.
The guys could be late.
They might come early.

Some people feel may is the strongest and might is the weakest, but many people use these interchangeably.



### E Type: Advice

A useful modal for this is should. 
I think you should attend the conference.

Some people also use ought to. This is less common.
			You ought to be on time.

Direct:		You   had   better not be late. (This is like a warning/threat)
In speech and chat, you might hear/see “You better not be late.”
NB: Don’t confuse this with “It’s better not to be late”, which is a much softer/more polite way of giving advice

### F Type: Offers

Shall in question form is a typical example:

			Shall I send the boxes to your office address?

You can only use shall with the pronoun ‘I’ and ‘we’ → Shall you I/ we send the boxes?
Shall in affirmative or negative sentences expresses future or strong intention
e.g. 	We shall succeed.
	I shan’t go. (old-fashioned)

You can also use other modals:
  would    you   like   something to drink?
			  May/Can    I help with anything?
			I   could    do your work for you.


### G Type: Obligation/Giving Orders

The strongest modal for this is must. 
All staff must attend this meeting.

Some people use it more to talk about things that are personal decisions.
			I must go to the supermarket this evening.

There’s another modal you can use, and some people use it more to refer to a rule or someone else’s order. 
			If you want to WFO next week, you  have    to     fill in this form by tonight.

Usually, these modal verbs are used interchangeably.


### H Type: Prohibition

When something is not allowed, you can use   mustn't   (not don’t have to).
			You  mustn't    press the red button.
You cannot cross the line.
You’re not allowed to edit that document.


### I Type: Lack of necessity

The best form to use for this is  don't    have to
			We      have to dress formally in the office.

You can also use other modal verbs:
You don’t need to call him Mr. Tan. James is OK.
You needn’t be so formal.

NB: If you use no need, remember that it fits into a sentence like this:
There is no need to answer that question.

Didn’t need to and Needn’t have different meanings in the past:
He didn’t need to bring a gift. (And maybe he didn’t)
He needn’t have brought a gift. (He brought a gift)
