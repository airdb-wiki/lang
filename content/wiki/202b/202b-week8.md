Exercise 1:
Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks. Each blank can have up to 6 words.

Jin: So... I called you in today  to talk about     your performance at work. I think we might have different opinions about the performance review that I wrote, and I wanted to hear your input on that. I’m sorry to say this, but   it seems to me that  you have been slacking off a bit lately.

May: OK I know I haven’t been working as hard as I should.  I take your point, but    I have been extremely stressed recently and the thing is, this performance review is really negative and will stay in my work files forever. 

Jin: I hear what you’re saying, but at the same time, it needs to be a reflection of your work at the moment. I know you are capable of doing well, May. Let’s take a look at a few things we can work on; how can we make sure you don’t come in late again?

May: How about if I set my alarm to an hour earlier every morning?

Jin: That sounds good, but I won’t change my review until you can show me that you can come  in on time. The other part is about breaks.    Help me understand  why  you’re taking such long breaks.   

May: The problem is that I have some family matters to attend to at the moment and they happen in the middle of the day.

Jin: Well, I’m sorry to hear that and I hope you’ll be able to get them sorted out. As long as you can show me that you’re not taking long breaks all the time, I’ll amend the review. I also want to talk about deadlines. Would you be willing to work overtime when you fall behind?

May: That’s no problem at all.

Jin: That’s great to hear. As soon as you can show me that you’re able to meet these deadlines, I'll revise the review.

May: I really appreciate your flexibility on that review, and am confident I’ll be able to show you how I’ve improved unless something big changes in my situation. 

Jin: I’m glad  we were able to work it out  


## Exercise 3:  Speaking

You have been called in for a meeting with your manager to speak about some performance issues. 

The ‘manager’ will introduce some areas of concern
The ‘employee’ will offer excuses or justification for the behavior

The manager and employee will look for ways to resolve the issues. Use the phrases from Exercise 2.


| Issue | What is the evidence of the problem? |
| --- | --- |
| Not being punctual at work (especially leaving early) | Has been coming in at 10:45 am and leaving at 5:30 pm |
| Being late for meetings | Regularly shows up 10 minutes late for meetings. |
| Not meeting deadlines | Has been submitting assignments 2 days late or longer without notice. |
