# 日常晨会
## 1. 开头

Ok, Let's get started.

## 项目进度


To look forward to / to be looking forward to – 期待
你可以用这个片语来表示对后续的发展感到期待，这是一个很好的表达方式来展现出你与合作伙伴共事的浓厚兴趣。这个片语有一个小地方要特别注意，最后面的＂to＂是介系词，所以后面要接名词或是动名词（N / V+ing），例如：

To sum up – 总结一下

Let's sum up...

To recap – 重述一遍

当你想要提醒所有参加者之前或是现在会议所提过的要点，可以用这个片语来表达：

Can you give me a recap of the points we covered last week?



Action points / next actions – 优先考虑事项/ 下一步行动
会议的参与者需要在会议结束后迅速地将刚才的会议要点，会议中提及的优先考虑事项（Action points）和下一步行动（next actions）写下来，这两个片语搭配使用的动词是set，例如：

Let's set some

1. “It looks like we've run out of time, so I guess we'll finish here.”

2. “If no one has anything else to say, I think we'll wrap this up.”

A: Alright. If no one has anything else to say, I think we'll wrap this up. Thanks
