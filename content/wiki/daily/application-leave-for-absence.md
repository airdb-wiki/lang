Application for Leave of Absence

Dear xxx, 


Having a nice day today.


I am writing to request to have classes online.

Please excuse my absence from school during the past Monday, but I still had my class online on time during that period(not absent for my classes).



As we all know the covid-19 situation in XXX is too bad recently,  more and more people are confirmed.

So please understanding why I apply to have classes online in the phase 2 arrangement.



On the other side, I have poor physical fitness and weak resistance.  I am very afraid to be spread because they are often eating and drinking in the classroom.  I think everyone should be heightened alert to fight against the viruses.



Kindly assist to proceed with my request, thank you.


Stay home stay safe.


Best regards,
Lee
