# 入门 与人相处的基本技巧

## 1. 不要批评、责怪或抱怨他人

Don't criticize,

condemn or complain.

Instead of condemnig people,

let's try to understand them.

Let's try to figure out why they do what they do.

Criticism is dangerous sometimes,

because it might wound a person's pride,

hurt his sense of importance,

and even arouse resentment.

When dealing with people,

Weare dealing with creatures of emotion.


## 2. 诚实而真诚地赞赏他人

Principle 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation

One of the most neglected virtues is appreciation,

but it's important in a relationship.

Somehow, we neglect to praise our families or friends

or fail to encourage them

when they have done something good.

Let's try to figure out the other person's good points,

and they will cherish your words

and treasure them and repeat them over a liftime.


## 3. 引发他人心中的渴望

Principle 3: Arouse in the other person an eager want

If there is any one secret of success,

it lies in the ability

to understand the other person's point of view

and see things from that person's angle.

Stop telling them what you want,

and try to help them realize it's for their benefit.
