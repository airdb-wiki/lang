- First of all, the PM does research and writes a PRD to describe the background and requirements.
- After that, we do a PRD review to align with all stakeholders.
- Next, the BE side conducts a tech design review.
- Then, the development is run. BE and FE are put together and after a few rounds of self-testing and bug-fixing, it is delivered to QA.
- Ideally, we give presentations to every team member. In the real world, usually the PM will be asked to take a look to provide feedback.
