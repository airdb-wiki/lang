Dialogue 1
A: Technical support. 
B: Hello Sam, it's Bob here. 
A: Hello Bob. What's gone wrong today? 
B: Err...yes, well   I seem to have a problem  sending emails. 
A:   Can you be a bit more specific ? 
B: Well, when I click on the `Send' button, the emails just remain in the outbox and don't get sent. 
A:  Have you tried   closing and opening the programme? 
B: Yes, I have. It didn't help one bit. 
A:   What about  restarting your computer? That might help. 
B: I've done that too. No change either. Has something gone wrong with the server again? 
A: I don't think so. Everything's working fine for me... Hmm...  Sounds like you may have   somehow altered the settings on your email programme. Either that or  it could have something to do with   your Internet connection. 
B:   I'm not sure it's  the connection. I have no problems accessing the internet. 
A: Hmm.   in that case, it's probably   your settings.   I'll come over    and try to sort it out. 
B: Thanks.


Dialogue 2 
A: Hi Daniel,  it looks like we have a serious problem  . I'm at the conference and I've got my presentation on in 25 minutes but the damn laptop has just crashed on me and I've lost all my PowerPoint slides! 
B: Good grief!  Are you saying  it won't even start up? 
A: Yes, exactly. 
B: OK, let's not panic.  I don't suppose you  made a backup of the data? 
A: Yes, I did, actually. There should be a CD on my desk. 
B: Yes, I can see it from here. Look,   what I suggest is that   you get on to the organisers and have them reschedule your presentation.   I'll send down  my assistant with a replacement laptop. 
A:  I'm not sure about that idea . The conference centre seems quite far from our office. How long will it take her to get here? 
B: Only about 30 minutes, assuming the traffic doesn't hold her up. So,  the best thing would be to  arrange your presentation for 3 o'clock. 
A:  Right, that makes sense   . I'll go and sort it out right away.
