Hi everyone:


Nice to meet you all!
I'm really excited to be joining the team in XXX for my career!

I've been in the XXX sphere for the past 5 years.
During my free time, I like to read manga and watch anime.
Also I’d like to do outdoor sports activities, like running and hiking.  
Please invite me if there are some interest groups.


Let’s work hard, play hard.


Best Regards
Kiwi
