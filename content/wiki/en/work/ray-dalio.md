达里奥：我在书里写了几百个原则，但我最重要的工作和生活原则主要是这5个

It's that I'm in in a transition in my life from the second phase of my life to the thrid phase of my life.

What I mean by that is that I believe that life happens in three phases.

In the first phase, your life you're dependent on others and you're learning, you're a student.

In the second phase of your life you're working. 

Other people are dependent on you, and you're trying to be successful.

When you get late in that stage in your life,  

the thing you want more than anything else is to help others to be successful without you.

And that's the stage I am in my life no longer do I want to be any more successful, 

But I want to pass that along.

And if I pass that along well, then I go  to the third stage. 

And I'm free and everybody's good.  

It's like many of you probably your parents what do they waht.

They want you to be successful without them, right?

And so that's the stage that's why I put out priciples that I'd like to share.

So I'm going to take you through my life and work principles.

There are many principles in the book, 

There are hundreds of principles in the book.

I want to try to convey my most important ones in a simple way to me.

This was what life is like, and I think it's probably what life is like for you.

You go after your audacious goals, and the along the way on those audacious goals.

You encounter your successes and you failures.

You're going fail, failure is an important part of that learning process.

And how you deal with failure is really important.

If you embrace failure not embarrassed about what life is like, and I think it's probably what life is like for you.

You go after your audacious goals, and the along the way on those audacious goals.

You encounter your successes and you failures.

You're going fail, failure is an important part of that learning process.

And how you deal with failure is really important.

If you embrace failure not embarrassed about it,

Then you will learn and you will learn principles, you known, 

and I'm also an entrepreneur, and as an invertor one has to be an independent thinker.

Because one has to bet against the consensus and be right.

That's because the consensus view is wbuilt into the price.

So only if you bet against the consensus, and a right are you gonna make a profit in the markets.

And when you ever you're betting against the consensus you're going to be wrong a fair amount of times.

And as an entrepreneur, 

it's the same thing you have to be an independent thinker,

and bet against the consensus,

and you're going to encounter failures.

We don't highlight those failures,

but that's part of the process

and from that, you have to learn priciples.



So, the thing that I began to learn is that my attitude about failing began to change.

I began to look at failures like puzzles that would give me gems.

If I cloud solve the puzzle,

and the puzzle was what would I do differently in the future.

So I wouldn't have that failure and the gem was a priciple that would help me.

And I would write down that priciple, 

So learning principles learning and changing is an important part,

then you improve,

and then you go on to your more audacious goals and that is the process over and over again.

I believe that's the evolutionary process.

If you think about it, you cloud about products.

It's the same for products.

It's the same for nature.

If you think of a product blackberry.

Write a new goal a new innovation,

But with time there's going to be failure.

So I've learned that an instinct that pain plus relection equals progress.

The pain is signaling to me something that I need to learn and I need to reflect.

And if I, if you develop that instinctual reaction pain plus relection equas progress.

And you think about that you cloud.


I think you can lear that instinctual reaction pain plus relection equas progress.

And you think about that you cloud.

I think you can learn.
