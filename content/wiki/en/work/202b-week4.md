A: So, how are the plans for the 2.2 campaign coming along? Can you give me an update?

B: Well, I’ve fixed all the bugs, and I’ve organised the parameters. But I haven’t done compatibility testing yet because of some trouble with some components. 

A: Okay. Have you ruled out the root cause of the bug? 

B: Yes, I have. I ruled it out last night. It’s ready to go. 

A: What about the advertisements? Have you arranged all the advertising?

B: No, not yet. I’m having trouble designing the layout. What do you think I should do?

A: Well, we’d better not wait too long. Have you considered using the new software? 

B: Yes, I’ve already tried that. It’s not compatible with our computer system.

A: Hmm. Well, I don’t mind taking a look at it later.  I’d also advise you to talk to our IT staff. Maybe our best option might be to hire extra staff. I suggest that you look into that, too.
