OK, <u>1 so that's</u> the background and the reason we developed the programme.

Any questions? OK. So, <u>2 let's move on</u> to the next point and take a closer look at the Traffic Support Centre itself. <u>3 As I said earlier</u>, the TSC was set up in 2001 to help traffic flow more smoothly, and basically to make the lives of motorists easier. In this part of my presentation <u>4 I'd like to tell</u> you about the centre's activities, how we work exactly and how motorists benefit from our services.


So, <u>5 Let me give you </u> a brief overview of the TSC's activities. Our main activities are to collect, analyse, and communicate traffic information. After collecting traffic data from a number of different sources, we analyse them and then we inform the media, the police, or other authorities, and - last but not least - the motorists.(...)


This now leads us to <u>6 my next point </u>. How doest the TSC collect data? Traffic-monitoring equipment has been installed across the main traffic routes, which help us gather real-time information on traffic speed and traffic flow. Additionally, we use vaiable traffic sensors and cameras. We also work together with other partners and authorities, for example the police, traffic officers, and the media. Let me show you a few examples of how this works. (...) <u>7 So much for </u> collecting data.


<u>8 Let's now turn</u> to the nnext issue. How do we communicate infor mation to motorists? We do this in a number of ways: by using electronic road signs, the Internet and radio, and state-of-the-art telephone technology. (...)

Let me now come back to <u>9 what I said earlier </u>. The TSC want to make the lives of motorists easier. So, in what ways doest the motorist benefit? Well, ... 
- First: through real-time information about the traffic situation.
- Second, through better advice about alternative routes. 
- Third, through safer roads and less driver stress.
