We chat informally and check in with each other all the time without having to schedule meetings. It’s important for me to have some flexiablity in my working hours. I think every team should have someone who is very outgoing , who makes the atmosphere more energetic and friendly. When I hire I look for someone who has versatile skills so they can handle many different technical situations. I have a great deal of confidence in how my team is run and its success, because they know what they’re doing and they’ve produced good results before. My team’s motivations to work is very high - everyone is enthusiastic and driven. My company is dedicate to its employees and puts their needs before those of the customers. I prefer a boss who is straightforward and tells me very directly whether something is good or not. There’s no need to be ‘nice’ or polite about it.\nB. Now tell your partner if these sentences are true for you or not.

As I mentioned before, I\u0026rsquo;d like to give you a brief overview of our activities.   6. I\u0026rsquo;d like to come back to this question later.   7. Let\u0026rsquo;s go back to what we were discussing earlier.   8. As I said earlier, I\u0026rsquo;ll be focusing on our new sales strategies.    Now listen to the presentation again and complete the sentences. #  OK, 1 so that\u0026rsquo;s the background and the reason we developed the programme.\nAny questions? OK. So, 2 let\u0026rsquo;s move on to the next point and take a closer look at the Traffic Support Centre itself. 3 As I said earlier, the TSC was set up in 2001 to help traffic flow more smoothly, and basically to make the lives of motorists easier. In this part of my presentation 4 I\u0026rsquo;d like to tell you about the centre\u0026rsquo;s activities, how we work exactly and how motorists benefit from our services.\nSo, 5 Let me give you  a brief overview of the TSC\u0026rsquo;s activities. Our main activities are to collect, analyse, and communicate traffic information. After collecting traffic data from a number of different sources, we analyse them and then we inform the media, the police, or other authorities, and - last but not least - the motorists.(\u0026hellip;)\nThis now leads us to 6 my next point . How doest the TSC collect data? Traffic-monitoring equipment has been installed across the main traffic routes, which help us gather real-time information on traffic speed and traffic flow. Additionally, we use vaiable traffic sensors and cameras. We also work together with other partners and authorities, for example the police, traffic officers, and the media. Let me show you a few examples of how this works. (\u0026hellip;) 7 So much for  collecting data.\n8 Let\u0026rsquo;s now turn to the nnext issue. How do we communicate infor mation to motorists? We do this in a number of ways: by using electronic road signs, the Internet and radio, and state-of-the-art telephone technology. (\u0026hellip;)\nLet me now come back to 9 what I said earlier . The TSC want to make the lives of motorists easier. So, in what ways doest the motorist benefit? Well, \u0026hellip;\n First: through real-time information about the traffic situation. Second, through better advice about alternative routes. Third, through safer roads and less driver stress.
