condemn or complain.
Instead of condemnig people,
let&amp;rsquo;s try to understand them.
Let&amp;rsquo;s try to figure out why they do what they do.
Criticism is dangerous sometimes,
because it might wound a person&amp;rsquo;s pride,
hurt his sense of importance,
and even arouse resentment.
When dealing with people,
Weare dealing with creatures of emotion.
2. 诚实而真诚地赞赏他人 # Principle 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation</description></item><item><title/><link>https://airdb.dev/lang/wiki/en/dialogue/moonlight-family/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://airdb.dev/lang/wiki/en/dialogue/moonlight-family/</guid><description>月光族 # Scene：新的一周，问问同事有什么计划吧? # Target: 作为月光族的你，无法周末没有什么计划，只能参见免费的花展了。 # Section # You: Any plans for this week?
